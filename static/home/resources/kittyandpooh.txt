02/07/2019, 16:10 - Fergal: I cancelled my last three viewings
02/07/2019, 16:11 - Fergal: I was tired and actually they were too difficult to get to from my office
02/07/2019, 16:11 - Fergal: So it didn't make sense
02/07/2019, 16:11 - Janice: I see.. but did you find a good one today :3?
02/07/2019, 16:12 - Janice: I’m reading my ppt content😂
02/07/2019, 16:12 - Janice: I’m really bad at typing chinese😂😂
02/07/2019, 16:13 - Fergal: Yes I found nice studio and house share one is okay too
02/07/2019, 16:13 - Fergal: But both have problems 😟
02/07/2019, 16:14 - Janice: What problem:<
02/07/2019, 16:14 - Fergal: House share is only available from 10th August
02/07/2019, 16:15 - Janice: Hmm how about you move to somewhere for few days first.. but it may be so annoying to move while you have to work😕
02/07/2019, 16:21 - Fergal: And studio landlord want so much pay upfront 😫
02/07/2019, 16:21 - Fergal: I'm not sure they will accept my offer without big payment
02/07/2019, 16:23 - Janice: How much they need you to pay for😮
02/07/2019, 16:23 - Fergal: Hmmm
02/07/2019, 16:23 - Fergal: I can't even remember exactly
02/07/2019, 16:23 - Fergal: But like 3000
02/07/2019, 16:23 - Janice: What :o
02/07/2019, 16:24 - Janice: Pounds? That’s too much
02/07/2019, 16:24 - Fergal: That is two months rent plus deposit
02/07/2019, 16:25 - Fergal: So I wouldn't pay rent for my last two months
02/07/2019, 16:25 - Janice: I see:o oh that’s similar to renting apartment here
02/07/2019, 16:26 - Fergal: Yeah the real estate said that I will have similar offers from most places
02/07/2019, 16:26 - Fergal: Because I have probation period on my job and I don't have guarantur
02/07/2019, 16:28 - Janice: I see, well how about rent house share for like one or two months first, then move out later :3?
02/07/2019, 16:29 - Fergal: Everywhere has minimum contract of 1 year with break clause after 6 months
02/07/2019, 16:29 - Fergal: Well everywhere okay
02/07/2019, 16:31 - Janice: Hmm try to look for more choices later☹ maybe there will be better ones..😢
02/07/2019, 16:33 - Fergal: Yeah I will tonight
02/07/2019, 16:33 - Fergal: Will probably have to go back to London later this week 😫

30/07/2019, 07:26 - Fergal: But just fine them or give them bad penalties like thwy cannot travel or put them criminal list so it will affect their jobs and traveling difderent countries
30/07/2019, 07:26 - Fergal: Then less normal people will join the protest
30/07/2019, 07:27 - Janice: I think some of them already had those penalties already but they really don’t care.. 🤦🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀

26/08/2019, 00:35 - Fergal: As kid
26/08/2019, 00:35 - Janice: Yes because they don’t look scary
26/08/2019, 00:36 - Janice: I drew jail for it using ink :3
26/08/2019, 00:36 - Fergal: Yes but a human sized ant would ve terrifying

26/08/2019, 00:36 - Janice: Better than 🐛

26/08/2019, 00:37 - Janice: 🤔well maybe..
26/08/2019, 00:38 - Fergal: But actually if an ant was  human sized it would die instantly
26/08/2019, 00:38 - Janice: Why:o
26/08/2019, 00:38 - Fergal: Its body is not designed to support body this size
26/08/2019, 00:38 - Janice: But it’s on scale right..?

26/08/2019, 00:40 - Fergal: Because their body is so small and light now
26/08/2019, 00:40 - Janice: 🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜 << so these are fine
26/08/2019, 00:40 - Janice: 🐜
26/08/2019, 00:40 - Fergal: But if their body was more heavy they would need thicker strong limvs

06/10/2019, 11:04 - Fergal: Just one app that works for a few different cities
06/10/2019, 11:05 - Fergal: So just combine my seoul and hk ones
06/10/2019, 11:05 - Fergal: And then i will add london, paris, dublin, copenhagen, hamburg

03/11/2019, 13:52 - Fergal: Actually i think first one
03/11/2019, 13:53 - Fergal: More space is better this time
03/11/2019, 13:53 - Fergal: What do you think Mistress?🐶❤
03/11/2019, 13:53 - Janice: i think it depends on what size we choose isnt it🤔
03/11/2019, 13:54 - Fergal: I think i would pick largest option for both
03/11/2019, 13:54 - Fergal: But that size isnt related to lenght of cage
03/11/2019, 13:54 - Fergal: It is for the metal that goes around my balls and dick
03/11/2019, 13:55 - Fergal: Metal ring

03/11/2019, 13:57 - Fergal: Let me look at measurements on that one
03/11/2019, 13:58 - Janice: yes then check for the size of that one🥰
03/11/2019, 13:58 - Fergal: Only small and medium ring size 😭😭
03/11/2019, 13:58 - Fergal: I want 50mm
03/11/2019, 14:00 - Fergal: But i guess 45 would be fine
03/11/2019, 14:01 - Fergal: Im really not sure about size of ring...
03/11/2019, 14:01 - Fergal: I did measurement so many times and got 2.5 inch diameter
03/11/2019, 14:01 - Fergal: Wait no
03/11/2019, 14:01 - Fergal: Wait yes 😂
03/11/2019, 14:02 - Janice: 😂what?

03/11/2019, 14:33 - Janice: So what size of the chastity should pick🤨
03/11/2019, 14:33 - Fergal: The biggest ring size i think
03/11/2019, 14:33 - Fergal: And then 3.5 inch length
03/11/2019, 14:34 - Fergal: Girth im not entirely sure but its not that important that one
03/11/2019, 14:34 - Janice: I see, so far the biggest ring size I found is 50mm

20/01/2020, 10:00 - Fergal: Of course~~~~
20/01/2020, 10:00 - Janice: What if I really pregnant🤨
20/01/2020, 10:00 - Fergal: Hmm I thought about it too last week
20/01/2020, 10:01 - Fergal: I want children with you
20/01/2020, 10:01 - Fergal: But not sure now is good time for us or the child

20/01/2020, 10:02 - Janice: Not good time definitely :3 so what would you do ~~
20/01/2020, 10:03 - Fergal: Well if we don't keep that would probably be most sensible thing to do now
20/01/2020, 10:04 - Fergal: But I would feel so bad for you to go through that without me there 😟😟😟😟
20/01/2020, 10:04 - Fergal: I think I would have to fly to you for a few days make sure you're okay
20/01/2020, 10:05 - Fergal: If we keep then I think I would have to look for work in Hong Kong
20/01/2020, 10:06 - Fergal: So you just stay where you are and in summer I would come over
20/01/2020, 10:06 - Janice: Hmm I see~~

20/01/2020, 10:22 - Fergal: Good girl 😘
20/01/2020, 10:23 - Fergal: Actually I'm quite against aborting just for convenience
20/01/2020, 10:24 - Fergal: I would support that 🥰❤
20/01/2020, 10:24 - Fergal: Then I would just come to you as soon as possible

27/01/2020, 07:36 - Fergal: Are you okay?
27/01/2020, 07:38 - Janice: Yes
27/01/2020, 07:39 - Fergal: What happened you profile picture?
27/01/2020, 07:42 - Janice: Just hided..
27/01/2020, 07:43 - Fergal: Why?
27/01/2020, 07:44 - Janice: Hate you
27/01/2020, 07:47 - Fergal: Why? 😫
27/01/2020, 08:01 - Fergal: Hmm actually
27/01/2020, 08:01 - Fergal: Because I was smoking?
27/01/2020, 08:42 - Janice: It’s fine just not in good mood
27/01/2020, 08:54 - Fergal: Hmmm olwyy
27/01/2020, 08:54 - Fergal: I just arrived to work
27/01/2020, 08:54 - Fergal: Talk later
27/01/2020, 09:20 - Janice: I was thinking should I say or not or just pretend I’m alright but I think it’s better to say it. I don’t want you think I’m annoying, but I really don’t want to be so depressed on my own and hiding. Not happy not just because you were smoking. Because you promised me you won’t just few weeks earlier and I was so sad at that time, you can easily forgot about what you said to me when I wasn’t there. Just don’t know how to trust you anymore. Thanks for telling me that you smoked but I really don’t know how to react because it’s pointless to ask you not to, which means the only thing I can to is to accept you smoked and smoking in future. But I really don’t like it and hate it, and I asked myself why I have to accept it even though I love you so much. Another thing is about you promised me you will delete those pictures but it takes forever, and you said they are worthless but I feel like I’m more worthless to you now. Maybe you were just busy or lazy, but doesn’t matter because if that was me I will always put you first. Just feel tired and disappointed, don’t want to talk. Im sorry for being so annoying like this, sometimes I can’t be perfect too. You can reply this later or whenever you want to, I understand it feels bad to read this, I feel so bad when typing too, I don’t want to or I don’t meant to sounds like I’m blaming or complaining, just want to tell you what I’m thinking.
27/01/2020, 12:50 - Fergal: Of course reading this makes me feel bad but that is not your fault. It's not annoying hearing you say this just makes me feel regret and disappointed in myself that I am making you feel like this again. I know when I told you in Berlin it made you feel so bad and the worst part was that I was hiding it from you that's why I wanted to tell you yesterday because I really don't want to hide anything from you. But I know that doesn't mean I can just do anything and tell you about it and expect for you to be okay with it. I agree you shouldn't just have to put up with me doing something that you have told me you really don't like. I don't want for you to have to feel like you have to constantly check if I have done anything you don't like but maybe now it will be difficult for you to not feel like that with me for sometime. You don't have to accept me smoking, you have told me how you feel about it and it is up to me know to respect how you feel. Honestly on Saturday night I did think about what happened in Berlin and thought it was the dishonesty that made you feel so bad rather than just the smoking but I understand now that this is something that hurts you and I really don't want to do that to you.
27/01/2020, 12:53 - Fergal: I'm sorry it's taken me so long to take down those pictures on Facebook and it was just because I don't usually like going to my Facebook and looking at photos from my past. They honestly meant nothing to me I promise I had already deleted all those photos from my phone which would be the only time I would see them.
27/01/2020, 12:54 - Fergal: It feels bad reading this and I haven't felt like talking much to anyone today because of it but I'm glad you told me because I really don't want you to resent me.
27/01/2020, 12:56 - Fergal: You're not worthless to me and you're not annoying. You really are the only person I care about and do think about you all the time. I know I need to listen to you better and respect how you feel.

03/02/2020, 19:52 - Janice: This issue will last forever I know.. maybe I need some time to reconsider .. I’m sorry I really don’t like that I don’t know how to understand it unless I go try
03/02/2020, 20:17 - Fergal: I don't understand are you saying that you start smoking?
03/02/2020, 20:17 - Fergal: This is not an issue that will last forever
03/02/2020, 20:17 - Fergal: But it is also not an issue I can just fix overnight
03/02/2020, 20:18 - Fergal: Need you to be more understanding and supportive than being so authoritarian and making me feel bad
03/02/2020, 20:19 - Fergal: Just makes me feel like I should hide things from you
03/02/2020, 20:19 - Fergal: I know I have to understand you too but just always feels like I'm apologising for feeling bad for something not really worth feeling bad about
03/02/2020, 20:21 - Janice: I know I’m sorry. But I don’t know I don’t think I can.. I just feel so insecure and disappointed sometimes.. like after you said you won’t and after a while a couple of days you said you may...... I don’t know have you ever tried to make up your mind or just to make me stop being sad so you just said that to me
03/02/2020, 20:21 - Janice: I know I’m too sensitive but I’m so worried about many things
03/02/2020, 20:21 - Janice: I tried not to overthink too much
03/02/2020, 20:22 - Fergal: It hurts when you think I would lie to you about something like my feelings and love for you
03/02/2020, 20:22 - Janice: <Media omitted>
03/02/2020, 20:22 - Janice: <Media omitted>

03/02/2020, 20:22 - Janice: <Media omitted>
03/02/2020, 20:23 - Janice: But it feels so heart breaking every time you promised something then you didn’t do .. makes me feel you not care about me when things happened or can just forgot about me ..
03/02/2020, 20:25 - Janice: And I’m so stressful to think about giving up things here while I’m not confident enough to be with you
03/02/2020, 20:53 - Fergal: Hard for me to reply to all of that right now...
03/02/2020, 20:54 - Fergal: I understand how you feel really
03/02/2020, 20:54 - Fergal: Especially about the smoking and breaking promises
03/02/2020, 20:55 - Fergal: I know it's not fair I do that to you
03/02/2020, 20:55 - Janice: No don’t have to say about that .. I’ll end up this issue
03/02/2020, 20:55 - Janice: Tomorrow I will go smoking, then it’s fair
03/02/2020, 20:55 - Fergal: Just stop
03/02/2020, 20:55 - Janice: I think I’ll feel better afterwards
03/02/2020, 20:55 - Fergal: Why are you talking like this?
03/02/2020, 20:56 - Janice: I don’t want this small things to hurt our relationship
03/02/2020, 20:56 - Fergal: Neither do I
03/02/2020, 20:56 - Fergal: I know we can't always agree or always be perfect
03/02/2020, 20:56 - Janice: I will try to accept, it’s ok
03/02/2020, 20:56 - Janice: Yes
03/02/2020, 20:57 - Fergal: But we can keep trying and not give up
03/02/2020, 20:57 - Fergal: If you smoke tomorrow then you are just giving up on me
03/02/2020, 20:57 - Janice: No it’s not like that
03/02/2020, 20:57 - Fergal: Maybe that's what you want to do
03/02/2020, 20:57 - Fergal: And you are just looking for an excuse for it
03/02/2020, 20:58 - Janice: But I don’t want myself to be crazy anymore, I don’t like being so emotional like that
03/02/2020, 20:58 - Janice: It’s not good for us if I’m always like this, and I don’t want you have to hide things from me
03/02/2020, 20:59 - Janice: It’s fine that’s my choice
03/02/2020, 20:59 - Fergal: You've already made up your mind?
03/02/2020, 20:59 - Fergal: You're being crazy now
03/02/2020, 20:59 - Fergal: I don't know
03/02/2020, 20:59 - Fergal: It's hard for me to talk to you now
03/02/2020, 21:00 - Fergal: I want to tell you I care about you and love you
03/02/2020, 21:00 - Fergal: But there's no point because you dont believe me or trust me
03/02/2020, 21:03 - Janice: I don’t know.. I want to believe you, i always believed you but just don’t want to get disappointed from you I hate that feeling. Even though sometimes makes me hate you, I know I must forgive you anyway and even though I’m scared or worried I know must go for you anyway. I have no choice
03/02/2020, 21:04 - Fergal: You have choice
03/02/2020, 21:04 - Fergal: Of course you do
03/02/2020, 21:05 - Fergal: I don't want to have somebody that can never trust me or believe me
03/02/2020, 21:06 - Fergal: You can focus on all the bad things I do and use that to justify your anger and hatred to me
03/02/2020, 21:07 - Fergal: But I know that I love you and don't want to be with anybody else so it's so frustrating when I hear you say you don't know if I love you or not because I smoked once every couple of months
03/02/2020, 21:11 - Fergal: You're a sweet girl and I know you are the only girl for me and when everything is going well it's so easy to be with you but when you get upset it's hard for me to talk to you
03/02/2020, 21:11 - Fergal: I don't understand why you get angry at me and most of the time I don't agree that you should be angry at me
03/02/2020, 21:12 - Fergal: I know I'm annoying but no more than you are to me sometimes
03/02/2020, 21:12 - Fergal: I agree the smoking is bad
03/02/2020, 21:13 - Fergal: And you're right to be upset for what I said tonight
03/02/2020, 21:14 - Fergal: Just wish you wouldn't be so quick to just write me off
03/02/2020, 21:14 - Janice: I’m sorry
03/02/2020, 21:14 - Fergal: Me too
03/02/2020, 21:16 - Janice: Im just being too crazy, please forget about bad things I’ve said I didn’t meant it
03/02/2020, 21:16 - Fergal: No 😭
03/02/2020, 21:16 - Fergal: Don't say that
03/02/2020, 21:16 - Fergal: Janice it's okay me too
03/02/2020, 21:16 - Fergal: I've been bad to you
03/02/2020, 21:17 - Fergal: And I really do love you so much
03/02/2020, 21:17 - Fergal: I hate making you feel like this
03/02/2020, 21:17 - Janice: I know you love me
03/02/2020, 21:17 - Fergal: And you didn't say anything that hurt of relationship or make me love you any less
03/02/2020, 21:18 - Fergal: I know you can be my emotionally little kitty kat sometimes
03/02/2020, 21:18 - Fergal: And that's okay
03/02/2020, 21:18 - Fergal: I love every part of you
03/02/2020, 21:18 - Fergal: And I know you love every part of me too
03/02/2020, 21:19 - Fergal: Even when I am being stubborn annoying pooh pooh
03/02/2020, 21:19 - Fergal: I understand it's frustrating
03/02/2020, 21:19 - Fergal: But I wouldn't change anything about you
03/02/2020, 21:20 - Fergal: I love you the way you are
03/02/2020, 21:21 - Janice: There is no way for me to really hate you, that makes me don’t know what should do when I realise I still love you so much even if you did things I don’t like. It’s frustrating
03/02/2020, 21:21 - Fergal: I know 😟
03/02/2020, 21:21 - Fergal: I feel so bad for that
03/02/2020, 21:21 - Fergal: And so grateful
03/02/2020, 21:22 - Fergal: But I will keep trying to be a better partner
03/02/2020, 21:22 - Fergal: Maybe it won't happen straight away
03/02/2020, 21:23 - Fergal: But I want to be everything you hoped for and deserve
03/02/2020, 21:23 - Janice: I know. And I think you are better than before already
03/02/2020, 21:23 - Janice: Just recently maybe I’m too stressful
03/02/2020, 21:23 - Fergal: I know it's a stressful time
03/02/2020, 21:24 - Fergal: Especially for you
03/02/2020, 21:24 - Fergal: I wish I could help you more
03/02/2020, 21:24 - Fergal: But my belly can't comfort you from so far away 😭😭😭
03/02/2020, 21:25 - Fergal: So frustrating for me knowing you're stressed and not feeling good and I know just one hug hug would make you feel better but I can't give you that 😭
03/02/2020, 21:26 - Janice: Yes this is a problem too, I don’t like feeling that especially at nighttime I easily gone crazy at night
03/02/2020, 21:26 - Janice: Sometimes maybe overthink myself too much and couldn’t sleep
03/02/2020, 21:27 - Janice: Sometimes miss you and hard to sleep, I don’t like that feeling
03/02/2020, 21:27 - Fergal: I think it is more difficult for you than me
03/02/2020, 21:27 - Fergal: I miss you so much too of course
03/02/2020, 21:28 - Fergal: And it really drives me crazy some nights or mornings waking up without you
03/02/2020, 21:28 - Fergal: But I what keeps me happy is knowing we will be together
03/02/2020, 21:29 - Janice: Especially few months ago when you start working, and sometimes couldn’t text me and you hang out with colleagues at night
03/02/2020, 21:29 - Fergal: And that I am so happy and comfortable to stay loyal and faithful to you and will wait as long as it takes to be with you
03/02/2020, 21:29 - Fergal: I know I remember that time
03/02/2020, 21:30 - Janice: Actually I cried many times before.. just didn’t tell you
03/02/2020, 21:30 - Fergal: I realised how mean and harmful it was to our relationship
03/02/2020, 21:30 - Fergal: And I don't do that for a long time
03/02/2020, 21:30 - Janice: But I was just being crazy, after sleep usually I realise I’m overthinking again
03/02/2020, 21:30 - Fergal: You can tell me
03/02/2020, 21:31 - Fergal: I don't understand why you have to hide these feelings from me
03/02/2020, 21:31 - Janice: Didn’t want to be annoying
03/02/2020, 21:31 - Fergal: It's not annoying
03/02/2020, 21:31 - Fergal: I want to know if you're feeling bad
03/02/2020, 21:31 - Janice: And I admit I’m overreacted I’m glad I didn’t tell you at that time
03/02/2020, 21:31 - Fergal: That's the last thing I want is for you to be all alone crying
03/02/2020, 21:32 - Fergal: Still you can tell me when you are feeling like that
03/02/2020, 21:32 - Fergal: And then when you are feeling better you can tell me too
03/02/2020, 21:32 - Janice: I forgot since when I told you more
03/02/2020, 21:33 - Fergal: What do you mean?
03/02/2020, 21:33 - Janice: Hmm I forgot why and when, but I told you more later
03/02/2020, 21:35 - Janice: I think I text you when I don’t feel good and miss you recently:3
03/02/2020, 21:35 - Fergal: Yes I think so
03/02/2020, 21:35 - Fergal: I love to see you message me like that
03/02/2020, 21:36 - Fergal: I mean I wish you didn't feel bad or miss me so much
03/02/2020, 21:36 - Fergal: But so happy you're thinking of me and tell me
03/02/2020, 21:36 - Janice: I didn’t want to be annoying so I didn’t do that much before, because people always complain about their girlfriend texting or calling
03/02/2020, 21:37 - Janice: Just don’t want to be like that
03/02/2020, 21:37 - Fergal: No it's okay 😟❤
03/02/2020, 21:37 - Fergal: I will never complain like that about you
03/02/2020, 21:37 - Janice: maybe...
03/02/2020, 21:37 - Fergal: No maybe~~~
03/02/2020, 21:38 - Fergal: I will not
03/02/2020, 21:38 - Janice: Okay...
03/02/2020, 21:38 - Fergal: Don't seem convinced?
03/02/2020, 21:39 - Janice: it’s hard to tell._.
03/02/2020, 21:40 - Fergal: I don't want you hiding any part of yourself from me Janice
03/02/2020, 21:40 - Fergal: You are the person I will spending the rest of my life with
03/02/2020, 21:40 - Janice: Yes I agree I shouldn’t
03/02/2020, 21:40 - Fergal: I want to know everything about you
03/02/2020, 21:41 - Janice: It’s not good I know, I didnt feel good whenever hiding from you
03/02/2020, 21:41 - Janice: <Media omitted>
03/02/2020, 21:41 - Fergal: It's okay baby Yoda girl 😟❤
03/02/2020, 21:42 - Fergal: I know you might be a little worried
03/02/2020, 21:42 - Fergal: But I'm never going to stop loving you
03/02/2020, 21:42 - Fergal: That is always a promise that I will keep to you
03/02/2020, 21:42 - Janice: Can I tell the truth ._.
03/02/2020, 21:42 - Janice: Not just a little..
03/02/2020, 21:42 - Fergal: Of course
03/02/2020, 21:43 - Janice: <Media omitted>
03/02/2020, 21:43 - Fergal: You very worried that I might not love you someday?
03/02/2020, 21:43 - Fergal: Or you will not love me someday?
03/02/2020, 21:44 - Janice: You ._.
03/02/2020, 21:45 - Janice: It’s impossible unless you cheated on me. and I think did think about that, actually maybe I’ll still love you in that case but just can’t be together again
03/02/2020, 21:46 - Fergal: Don't think about that
03/02/2020, 21:46 - Fergal: That will never happen
03/02/2020, 21:46 - Janice: This might be possible ._.
03/02/2020, 21:46 - Fergal: No it's not possible
03/02/2020, 21:46 - Fergal: Really just stop
03/02/2020, 21:46 - Janice: I imagined what if someday I lost my legs or arms
03/02/2020, 21:46 - Fergal: Omg Janice that is ridiculous
03/02/2020, 21:46 - Janice: ... I really thought about that 😑
03/02/2020, 21:47 - Fergal: I will of course still love you
03/02/2020, 21:47 - Fergal: That wouldn't matter at all
03/02/2020, 21:47 - Fergal: I will always take care of you
03/02/2020, 21:47 - Fergal: I want you to be my wife
03/02/2020, 21:47 - Fergal: That means I will never leave you and always be there for you no matter what
03/02/2020, 21:47 - Janice: No... if you’re still young I won’t let you be with me if I became like that
03/02/2020, 21:47 - Fergal: Especially if you get sick
03/02/2020, 21:47 - Janice: It’s not good
03/02/2020, 21:48 - Fergal: No I won't leave you still
03/02/2020, 21:48 - Janice: <Media omitted>
03/02/2020, 21:48 - Fergal: Even if you tell me to go I won't
03/02/2020, 21:48 - Fergal: You belong to me and you always will
03/02/2020, 21:48 - Janice: I’ll be careful then not to hurt myself

03/02/2020, 21:50 - Janice: What I mean i wasn’t try to be funny... I know it’s ridiculous scenario but it’s not impossible.....
03/02/2020, 21:50 - Fergal: Don't want you to have to spend all day taking care of annoying grandpa pooh pooh
03/02/2020, 21:50 - Fergal: I know
03/02/2020, 21:51 - Fergal: Of course can happen to anyone
03/02/2020, 21:51 - Fergal: But there's no point about thinking about it unless it happens
03/02/2020, 21:51 - Janice: Yes...
03/02/2020, 21:51 - Fergal: If that happens I know we will still be okay
03/02/2020, 21:52 - Janice: Yes😟

03/02/2020, 21:54 - Fergal: Doesn't just belong to me now
03/02/2020, 21:54 - Janice: Yes

03/02/2020, 21:55 - Fergal: Need to pee pee
03/02/2020, 21:56 - Janice: <Media omitted>
03/02/2020, 21:56 - Janice: And then ppl asked how is it possible his wife got pregnant and I saw somebody drew this

03/02/2020, 21:58 - Fergal: Yes but it's not that bad I think
03/02/2020, 21:58 - Fergal: The guy has wife and kids
03/02/2020, 21:58 - Fergal: If the guy is alone and people laugh at him it would be worse
03/02/2020, 21:59 - Fergal: He is probably happy and doesn't care what other people think
03/02/2020, 21:59 - Janice: Yes.. he is better than me he knows how to swim

09/02/2020, 19:46 - Janice: Feels like it’ll sink someday..
09/02/2020, 19:47 - Fergal: It is the first country expected to disappear due to rising sea levels 😂
09/02/2020, 19:47 - Janice: Yes it looks like so easy to be like that
09/02/2020, 19:48 - Janice: <Media omitted>

09/02/2020, 19:56 - Janice: Maybe
09/02/2020, 19:56 - Janice: Yes they look similar
09/02/2020, 20:25 - Fergal: I just thought if you are coming London after you graduate

24/03/2020, 14:21 - Fergal: oh it seems to apply in the uk is only for extending current visa
24/03/2020, 14:22 - Fergal: so probably you are right can only apply from outside
24/03/2020, 14:22 - Janice: Can’t apply within Uk..
24/03/2020, 14:22 - Janice: <Media omitted>

24/03/2020, 14:24 - Janice: Yes...
24/03/2020, 14:45 - Fergal: Should I come HK?
24/03/2020, 14:45 - Fergal: We were talking about it in office
24/03/2020, 14:46 - Fergal: If we are working from home then we could just fly away somewhere and work there
24/03/2020, 14:46 - Fergal: Working holiday
24/03/2020, 14:46 - Janice: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 14:47 - Janice: You can’t come here.. hk banned all countries travellers
24/03/2020, 14:47 - Fergal: Rilakkuma girl~~

24/03/2020, 14:48 - Janice: Sigh, not gd
24/03/2020, 14:48 - Janice: But I still book it first
24/03/2020, 14:48 - Janice: Will keep checking
24/03/2020, 14:48 - Fergal: Okay yes book it
24/03/2020, 14:49 - Janice: If they reopen it earlier I’ll book it earlier
24/03/2020, 14:49 - Fergal: How long after doing that do you need to wait?
24/03/2020, 14:49 - Fergal: I mean how long after you have this appointment
24/03/2020, 14:49 - Fergal: Do you need to wait for visa
24/03/2020, 14:50 - Janice: Usually ppl said within 3 weeks
24/03/2020, 14:50 - Janice: But I think they’ll have delay
24/03/2020, 14:50 - Janice: 🙃
24/03/2020, 14:50 - Janice: That’s so bad
24/03/2020, 14:50 - Fergal: Probably...😭
24/03/2020, 14:50 - Fergal: Annoying
24/03/2020, 14:50 - Fergal: Let's stay positive
24/03/2020, 14:51 - Fergal: But after you have applied
24/03/2020, 14:51 - Fergal: Can you come here?
24/03/2020, 14:52 - Janice: Maybe not? Need to go in person
24/03/2020, 14:53 - Fergal: If you can then just come here
24/03/2020, 14:53 - Janice: But I can do nothing there:/ can’t work and need to go back in 3 months and go back to apply visa ..
24/03/2020, 14:54 - Fergal: Why go back and apply?
24/03/2020, 14:54 - Fergal: Apply for the visa then come here
24/03/2020, 14:55 - Fergal: They say you must apply for your visa before coming here
24/03/2020, 14:55 - Fergal: So maybe that means you can apply and stay here while you wait
24/03/2020, 14:56 - Janice: Hmmm no
24/03/2020, 14:56 - Janice: It’s not like this
24/03/2020, 14:56 - Janice: Need go to that centre in person😕

24/03/2020, 14:58 - Janice: So frustrating

25/03/2020, 14:05 - Fergal: 😘
25/03/2020, 14:06 - Janice: I just send you 1 box face mask first because want more space for tissue paper
25/03/2020, 14:06 - Janice: You only need 1 face mask max per day
25/03/2020, 14:06 - Fergal: Okay
25/03/2020, 14:06 - Janice: So it’s enough for like 2 months :3

25/03/2020, 14:06 - Fergal: Nevermind
25/03/2020, 14:08 - Janice: Just use 1 per day, but if you need reuse, you need to place it in envelope or fold it with tissue paper. Can’t let the outer side touch yourself or other things
25/03/2020, 14:08 - Fergal: Ohhhhh
25/03/2020, 14:08 - Fergal: Smart kitty

25/03/2020, 14:09 - Janice: And we usually place a tissue paper inside the face mask, change it from time to time especially when you talk too much
25/03/2020, 14:09 - Janice: So the face mask won’t smell too bad
25/03/2020, 14:10 - Fergal: Hmmm

31/03/2020, 09:13 - Janice: Today can leave work on time
31/03/2020, 09:16 - Fergal: that's good~~~~
31/03/2020, 09:18 - Janice: I’m thinking should I make a loan first before going to uk ._.
31/03/2020, 09:19 - Janice: Just in case can’t find job ._.
31/03/2020, 09:19 - Fergal: Hmmm maybe
31/03/2020, 09:19 - Fergal: That's what I did
31/03/2020, 09:19 - Janice: Yes._.
31/03/2020, 09:19 - Fergal: You will get universal credit eventually I think
31/03/2020, 09:20 - Fergal: Like jobseekers allowance
31/03/2020, 09:20 - Janice: And it’s better for my credit grading I think if I pay back on time
31/03/2020, 09:20 - Fergal: Even if you have to wait a few months
31/03/2020, 09:20 - Janice: ._.
31/03/2020, 09:20 - Fergal: They should pay you back for all of the months you were looking for a job
31/03/2020, 09:20 - Janice: Hmmm I’m afraid that won’t cover wh applicants :/
31/03/2020, 09:21 - Fergal: Wh applicants?
31/03/2020, 09:21 - Janice: Working holiday :3
31/03/2020, 09:21 - Fergal: It might
31/03/2020, 09:21 - Janice: ._.
31/03/2020, 09:21 - Fergal: Just need to be resident I think
31/03/2020, 09:21 - Janice: I’ve never heard anyone apply for that ..
31/03/2020, 09:22 - Janice: <Media omitted>
31/03/2020, 09:23 - Fergal: Hmm I'll check it out but I think you should be okay
31/03/2020, 09:23 - Janice: 😢
31/03/2020, 09:23 - Janice: But many ppl are unemployed now isn’t it .~.
31/03/2020, 10:38 - Fergal: Hmm yes maybe demand for that has gone up
31/03/2020, 10:38 - Fergal: But government should be able to handle that
31/03/2020, 10:39 - Fergal: Separately
31/03/2020, 10:39 - Fergal: I know in Ireland if you lost your job due to coronavirus you get separate pay
31/03/2020, 10:40 - Fergal: Actually think you can claim both coronavirus compensation and job seekers allowance
31/03/2020, 10:44 - Janice: But the problem is I’m not resident😫
31/03/2020, 10:44 - Janice: <Media omitted>
31/03/2020, 10:48 - Fergal: You will be resident as soon as you get visa
31/03/2020, 10:48 - Fergal: I am looking into it
31/03/2020, 10:48 - Fergal: And some visas have right for recourse to public funds
31/03/2020, 10:48 - Fergal: Which means you can claim that
31/03/2020, 10:49 - Janice: I see ._.
31/03/2020, 10:51 - Fergal: Oh wait just saw
31/03/2020, 10:51 - Fergal: Your visa doesn't allow you to get public funds
31/03/2020, 10:51 - Janice: Yes make sense ._.
31/03/2020, 10:51 - Fergal: So I think that would mean no access to universal credit
31/03/2020, 10:51 - Janice: Because if ppl can get that they won’t work...
31/03/2020, 10:52 - Fergal: Yes but you can only get that if you can prove you are looking for work
31/03/2020, 10:52 - Janice: Yes but still doesn’t make sense for tier5 to get that ._.
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Fergal: Yeah
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Fergal: But maybe I can
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Fergal: If I have an unemployed partner
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Janice: But you have work
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Janice: Hmm🤔
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Fergal: But maybe have to be married
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Janice: Then need to see how they define partner
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Fergal: Or living together for 2 years
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Fergal: Yes
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Janice: Maybe need to show proof again
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Janice: Yes
31/03/2020, 10:53 - Janice: <Media omitted>
31/03/2020, 10:54 - Fergal: Let's just get married 🐶❤
31/03/2020, 10:54 - Janice: Need to wait until 26 ._.
31/03/2020, 10:54 - Fergal: Annoying
31/03/2020, 10:54 - Fergal: Need to change your birth certificate
31/03/2020, 10:54 - Janice: Actually that’s the year my visa expire
31/03/2020, 10:54 - Fergal: Hmmm so if we want to stay just get married
31/03/2020, 10:54 - Janice: It’s fine just less than 2 years from now ._.
31/03/2020, 10:55 - Fergal: Yesss~~

31/03/2020, 10:55 - Janice: Can’t make happy face ._.
31/03/2020, 10:55 - Fergal: Everything will okay

17/04/2020, 21:00 - Fergal: Dear, Oisín, Eva, Des & Brigid,

I hope you are all staying safe and healthy. Here in Hong Kong we have enough for the time being so I can share with you as I understand it is quite difficult to find masks in Ireland.

When using masks it's important to remember to:
• Use one mask per day
• Make sure the wire on top sits on your nose all the time and you can bend the metal at the top to fit your face
• When taking off the masks never touch the outside and dispose safely and quickly and if reusing make sure not to put it on inside out.
• If you are wearing the mask for long period of time you can place piece of tissue inside just infront of your mouth and you can replace that as you go

So far my family and I are doing well and thankfully healthy. We appreciate you thinking of us and hope you get through this safe and sound.

Love,
Jan Jan
